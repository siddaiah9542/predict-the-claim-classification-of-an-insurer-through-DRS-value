# predict-the-claim-classification-of-an-insurer-through-DRS-value
Given was a dataset from insurance domain. The dataset contained information about the complaints from the people of Connecticut against the insurance companies in which they filed a claim for their coverage along with the reason why the complaint was registered in the first place. Also, there was another dataset provided which had the target variable (degree of regulatory concern) for each Insurance company.  Degree of Regulatory Concern: Based on the above provided features and the complaint regulatory system of the insurance company, each company has been rated on a scale of 1-3 with 1 being poor, 2 being average and 3 being outstanding. Poor regulatory concern implies that the insurance company is not compliant with the laws and regulatory body as well as do not maintain good CRS.  Since it is tedious to look into each and every complaint that is raised against a company and then rate them on their compliance, a Machine-Learning model would be a right fit, which, given a set of features can predict the right degree of regulatory concern.  This becomes a classic case of ML classification problem, where we are trying to classify the samples into three categories. Also, we will have a better understanding of what features play an important role in predicting the DRC as poor which will further help the business to improve their standards and be compliant with the laws and regulatory body.
